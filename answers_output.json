    "question": "Could you explain why matrices help solve { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }?",
    "answer": "A great example of using matrices to solve a system of linear equations!\n\nThe system of equations you provided is:\n\nx + y = 5\nx - y = 1\n\nTo solve this system, we can represent the two equations as a matrix equation:\n\n| 1 1 |   | x |   | 5 |\n| 1 -1 | = | y | * | 1 |\n\nHere, the matrix on the left-hand side is called the coefficient matrix, and the matrix on the right-hand side is the constant matrix. The vertical lines are called the augmented matrix.\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use row operations to transform the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF). The RREF will have the",

    "answer": "The Profitability Index (PI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of a project or investment by comparing its expected return on investment (ROI) to its cost. It is calculated by dividing the expected profit by the expected cost of the project.\n\nThe formula for Profitability Index is:\n\nProfitability Index (PI) = (Expected Profit / Expected Cost)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Expected Profit is the expected revenue minus the expected costs\n* Expected Cost is the total cost of the project\n\nA higher Profitability Index indicates that the project is more profitable, while a lower index indicates that the project is",
