    "question": "Explain the process of plate tectonics and how it creates mountains.",
    "answer": "Plate tectonics is the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is broken into several large plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below. As these plates move, they can collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, resulting in various geological processes. When two plates collide, the edges of the plates are compressed and pushed upwards, forming mountains. This process is known as orogenesis. The Himalayan mountain range, for example, was formed as the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate.",

    "question": "What were the main causes of World War I?",
    "answer": "The main causes of World War I can be attributed to a complex interplay of factors, including:\n\n1. Imperialism: The competition for colonies and resources in Africa and Asia led to tensions between European powers, particularly between Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium.\n2. Nationalism: The rise of nationalist sentiment in various countries, such as Germany, Italy, and the Balkans, contributed to an atmosphere of tension and aggression.\n3. Militarism: The buildup of military forces and the glorification of war in many European countries created an environment in which war became increasingly likely.\n4. Alliances: The complex system of alliances between European powers, including the Triple Entente (France, Britain, and Russia) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy), created a situation in which a small conflict could quickly escalate into a larger war.\n5. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in June 1914 triggered a chain reaction of events that led to the outbreak of war.\n\nThese factors, combined with a complex system of diplomatic tensions and rivalries, ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I in July 1914.",
