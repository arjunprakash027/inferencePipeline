    "question": "Could you explain why matrices help solve { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }?",
    "answer": "A great question about matrices!\n\nMatrices can help solve systems of linear equations like { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 } by representing the coefficients of the variables (x and y) in a compact and organized way. Here's how:\n\nWe can write the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 1  1 | 5 |\n| 1 -1 | 1 |\n\nThe first row represents the coefficients of x and y in the first equation (x + y = 5), and the second row represents the coefficients of x and y in the second equation (x - y = 1). The right-hand column represents the constants on the right-hand side of each equation.\n\nTo solve the system, we",

    "question": "In what ways did the Industrial Revolution influence political ideologies in Europe?",
    "answer": "The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the development of political ideologies in Europe, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Here are some key ways in which it influenced the evolution of political thought:\n\n1. **Rise of Liberalism**: The Industrial Revolution created a new class of industrialists and entrepreneurs who accumulated wealth and power. This led to the emergence of liberal ideologies that emphasized individual rights, free markets, and limited government intervention. Thinkers like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill advocated for laissez-faire economics and the protection of property rights.\n2. **Socialism and the Labor Movement**: As workers became increasingly exploited and disillusioned with the harsh conditions of industrialization, socialist and labor movements emerged to challenge the power",

It is a key decision-making tool used to evaluate the potential profitability of a project or investment opportunity.\n\nThe formula for Profitability Index is:\n\nPI = (Present Value of Future Cash Inflows - Present Value of Future Cash Outflows) / Initial Investment\n\nA higher PI value indicates a more profitable project or investment, while a lower PI value suggests a less profitable one.",
