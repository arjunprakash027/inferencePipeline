    "question": "Could you explain why matrices help solve { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }?",
    "answer": "Matrices can be a powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations like the one you provided. Here's why:\n\nThe system of equations you provided is:\n\nx + y = 5\nx - y = 1\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. However, matrices can help us solve it more easily.\n\nWe can represent the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 1 1 | 5 |\n| 1 -1 | 1 |\n\nThe idea is to transform the matrix into row-echelon form, which makes it easy to solve for the variables.\n\nTo do this, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y-variable:\n\n| 1 1 | 5 |\n|",

    "question": "In what ways did the Industrial Revolution influence political ideologies in Europe?",
    "answer": "The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the development of political ideologies in Europe, leading to significant changes in the way people thought about the role of government, the economy, and social class. Here are some key ways in which the Industrial Revolution influenced political ideologies in Europe:\n\n1. **Emergence of Liberalism**: The Industrial Revolution created a new class of industrialists and entrepreneurs who sought to challenge the traditional aristocratic and monarchical systems of power. Liberalism, which emphasized individual rights, free markets, and limited government intervention, emerged as a response to the perceived injustices of the old order.\n2. **Rise of Socialism**: The Industrial Revolution also led to the growth of urban poverty and the exploitation of workers, which fueled the development",

    "answer": "The Profitability Index (PI) is a financial metric that measures the return on investment (ROI) of a project or investment by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows to the initial investment. It is calculated by dividing the present value of the expected future cash flows by the initial investment.\n\nThe formula for the Profitability Index is:\n\nProfitability Index (PI) = Present Value of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment\n\nThe Profitability Index is a useful tool for evaluating the viability of a project or investment by providing a single number that indicates the expected return on investment.
