medium,Could you explain why matrices help solve { x + y = 5 ; x - y = 1 }?,"They package the system as A·v=b with A=[[1,1],[1,-1]], v=[x,y]^T, b=[5,1]^T. You can then use inverse matrices or row-reduction to solve systematically: A^{-1}b → x=3, y=2.",algebra,390aa1a849d4f3dba4437060fc9c20d6cb39f82357fd3d9b5d922e5965c14324,"## Step 1: Understand the given equations
The given equations are linear equations in the form of ax + by = c, where a = 1, b = 1, and c = -3.

## Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
To solve the system of equations, we can use the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.

## Step 3: Plug in the values

medium,what is Profitability Index,Benefit to cost ratio including discount,Finance,8,"The Profitability Index (PI) is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a business or project. It is a ratio that calculates the return on investment (ROI) of a project or investment, taking into account the initial investment, the revenue generated, and the profit earned.

The Profitability Index is calculated by dividing the profit earned by the initial investment and then dividing the result by the initial investment. The resulting ratio is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.

The formula for the Profitability Index is:

Profitability Index = (Profit / Initial Investment) x 100"
